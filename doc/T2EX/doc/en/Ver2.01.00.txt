                                                               June 17, 2015

- Modifications of T2EX Ver 2.01.00 -

----
Separation of source code:

  - The source code of T2EX main part and the source code derived from NetBSD 
    or OpenBSD have been separated into different packages.

        - t2ex_source.tar.gz  the source code of T2EX main part
          (the newly created part)
            -> This is covered under T-License 2.0.

        - bsd_source.tar.gz   the source code derived from NetBSD or OpenBSD
            -> This is not covered under T-License 2.0.

UPDATE OF SOURCE CODE:

  - Modification overview
        - Misspelled and incorrect words and phrases have been corrected.
        - The end of line sequence has been unified into a LF.
        - The file headers have been cleaned up.
        - The warnings such as casting of the pointers of data of mismatched 
          signedness will no longer be generated.

  - Bugs have been fixed.
        - Support of BIG ENDIAN
        - The bug that shows up when TMO_FEVR is specified to so_select_ms(), 
          and so_select_us() has been fixed.
        - The bug of failing to read data with certain FAT parameters has been 
          fixed.
        - The recognition of FAT32 was not perfect. It has been fixed.
        - The bug which updated the access date of the first entry when the 
          root directory of FAT12/16 was accessed has been fixed.

  - The codes have been improved.
        - Support of T-Kernel 2.02.00
            - usermain_t2ex/ has been removed and the files under it have been 
              moved to sysmain/src/.
            - usermain.c has been renamed to usermain_t2ex.c.
            - Libraries are now built also when build is attempted in 
              sysmain/build/tef_em1d.
            - Suffix _t2ex has been added to the names of binary files 
              produced during build (to distinguish them from those produced 
              during TK2-only build).
            - RAM-Kernel boots via launch.S now.
        - Memory use has been reduced by code improvement.
        - Unnecessary codes as T2EX have been deleted.
        - T2EX will be shut down immediately after appl_main is terminated.
        - Program load-related commands (load, loadspg, unload) have been 
          added to sample shell.

  - Improvements for build.
        - Option specification for build has been fixed to function correctly.
        - -g is now added to ASFLAGS for build in debug mode.
        - Libraries to link are now selected automatically according to 
          selected T2EX functions.
        - The debug specification of make mode=debug in sysmain no longer 
          propagates.
        - Functions such as bchkspc and friends are not included in build.
        - Library dependency order has been modified with the addition of the 
          definition of syslog().
        - Dependencies related to "make source" have been modified.
        - The files below kernel/sysdepend of TK2 will not be overwritten.
        - mkt2exsvc has been modified so as not to overwrite imalloc.c.
        - The file t2ex/etc/mkt2exsvc, and the directory t2ex/etc/sysdepend/ 
          have been moved under etc/.
