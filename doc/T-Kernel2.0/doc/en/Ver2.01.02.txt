"Modification of T-Kernel 2.0 Source Code Package Ver 2.01.02"
							June 25, 2012

- Modification of T-Kernel Ver 2.01.02 -

----
[K-20102-1]The start-up of T-Kernel for RAM load configuration has been modified.

MODIFICATION:
When T-Kernel (kernel-ram.sys) for RAM load configuration was linked, the same 
start-up file as T-Kernel (kernel-rom.rom) for writing to ROM was linked.
T-Kernel for RAM load configuration is not described in the instruction document, 
but Makefile description for T-Kernel for RAM configuration has been modified.

MODIFIED FILE(S):
kernel/sysmain/src/Makefile.common
kernel/sysmain/build_drv/Makefile.common


[K-20102-2] The emulator program has been modified.

MODIFICATION:
 * The failure of RTC not operating is corrected. 
 * The incorrect IRQ number assigned to the network controller is corrected.
   IRQ172 was used for the target hardware, but IRQ127 was used for Qemu 
   (It is now changed to IRQ172).
 * Packet could not be received normally after the driver disposed the packet with 
   the network controller. This is now fixed.
   - Specifically, when the "Receive Data FIFO Fast Forward" function of LAN9221 
     is used, the controller extended abnormal state.

MODIFIED FILE(S):
emulator/tef_em1d/bin/qemu-tef_em1d.exe
emulator/tef_em1d/build/qemu-0.12.4-tef_em1d.tar.gz
